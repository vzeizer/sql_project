# *SQL Project Chinook*

## In this project the database Chinook is investigated, which holds information of a music store.
## I am going to help Chinook staff to comprehend the midia of its store, its clients, employers and bill information.

## Project Instructions (according to Udacity)

### You will need to follow the instructions in the last three topics to get the database Chinook working at your own machine and verify if it is configured properly.
### There will be two parts in this project.

### The _first part_ is questions that are going to assure if you control the main topics taught in the SQL classes.
### Although these questions are not going to be reviewed by a reviewer, they will help you to self-evalulate.

### The _second part_ is a presentation.
### Similarly to the first project, there is not a 'right answer' for the second part of the project.
### You have the ability to be creative in the questions you are going to make.
### Afterwards, you will write a SQL query to extract the necessary data to successfully answer to your question.
### Use the downloaded data to construct a graphic (bar chart, histogram or another plot) that answers to your question.
### The essential when submitting the project is going to be discussed later. 
### In order to your presentation to be reviewed, you will need to save the slides in PDF.
